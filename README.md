# Evertale-Bot-Public
This project is an automation bot for the mobile game Evertale, built with Python. It uses image recognition and     ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to interact with the game running in the MEmu Android emulator. The bot is designed to automate repetitive in-game tasks such as completing daily quests, participating in events, and managing resources.
